Before (reset drivers):
  let drivers = {}
  let drivers.zoxide = { 'mock': 'zoxide driver' }
  let drivers['z.lua'] = { 'mock': 'z.lua driver' }

Execute (returns the driver):
  let zcd#driver = 'zoxide'
  AssertEqual 'zoxide', zcd#validate#driver(drivers)

Execute (returns null if the driver is invalid):
  let zcd#driver = 'bacon'
  silent AssertEqual 'ERROR', zcd#validate#driver(drivers)

Execute (returns null if the driver is null):
  let zcd#driver = v:null
  AssertEqual v:null, zcd#validate#driver(drivers)
