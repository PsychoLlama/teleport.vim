Before (reset drivers):
  let drivers = {}
  let drivers.zoxide = { 'mock': 'zoxide driver' }
  let drivers['z.lua'] = { 'mock': 'z.lua driver' }

  unlet! g:zcd#path
  unlet! g:zcd#driver

Execute (returns the driver):
  let zcd#driver = 'zoxide'
  AssertEqual 'zoxide', zcd#validate#driver(drivers)

Execute (returns null if the driver is invalid):
  let zcd#driver = 'bacon'
  silent AssertEqual 'ERROR', zcd#validate#driver(drivers)

Execute (returns null if the driver is null):
  let zcd#driver = v:null
  AssertEqual v:null, zcd#validate#driver(drivers)

Execute (returns null if the path is unset):
  AssertEqual v:null, zcd#validate#path()

Execute (returns the path if it's readable):
  let zcd#path = expand('%:p:h') . '/README.md'
  AssertEqual zcd#path, zcd#validate#path()

Execute (returns null if the path is invalid):
  let zcd#path = expand('%:p:h')
  silent AssertEqual v:null, zcd#validate#path()
