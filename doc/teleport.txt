OVERVIEW                                                     *teleport-overview*

If you're using this plugin, chances are you've installed one of these tools:

- https://github.com/rupa/z
- https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua
- https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide

They all do pretty much the same thing: they learn your most common
directories, and when given a pattern, they jump to the most likely match.

`teleport.vim` does the same thing, but in your favorite editor. Try it! >

neat.

CONFIG                                                         *teleport-config*

Under the hood this just calls through to a shell program. It tries to be
clever and infer the location where possible, but it doesn't always have
enough information. You might need to configure it manually.

There are two bits of configuration:
- The file path of the executable program
- Which driver to use

Setting the executable path~
                                                                      *zcd#path*

First find the file path of the executable, then copy it into your vimrc: >

  let zcd#path = expand('~/path/to/z/z.sh')
<
teleport.vim should be able to infer the driver from that alone. You're done!

Configuring the driver~
                                                                    *zcd#driver*

If teleport.vim wasn't able to infer the driver, or it inferred the wrong
driver, you can force it to use a specific implementation: >

  let zcd#driver = 'zoxide'
<
These are your options:
- `z`
- `z.lua`
- `zoxide`

rupa/z~
>
  let zcd#path = expand('~/path/to/z/z.sh')
  let zcd#driver = 'z' " Optional
<
z.lua~
>
  let zcd#path = expand('~/path/to/z.lua/z.lua')
  let zcd#driver = 'z.lua' " Optional
<
zoxide~
>
  " Uses the global command "zoxide".
  let zcd#driver = 'zoxide'

FUNCTIONS                                                   *teleport-functions*

This might appeal to advanced vim users. `teleport.vim` exposes functions you
can use in your own scripts.

zcd#FindMatches({search_term})                               *zcd#FindMatches()*

                DEPRECATED: use `teleport#api#find_matches(...)` instead.

teleport#api#find_matches({search_term})           *teleport#api#find_matches()*

                Returns a list of directories matching {search_term}. Each
                result is a dictionary containing metadata: >

                  [{ 'frecency': 3.75, 'directory': '/absolute/path/' }]

<                Results are ordered descending by likelyhood (most likely
                comes first).

                WARNING: if the driver is misconfigured, the method will
                print a warning and return `'ERROR'`. If you'd prefer to hide
                the error output, use |:silent|.

                Added in v0.3.0.

teleport#api#find_match({search_term})               *teleport#api#find_match()*

                Returns the first match from |teleport#api#find_matches()|. If
                there aren't any matches, it returns `v:null`.

                Added in v0.3.0.

teleport#api#query({search_term})                         *teleport#api#query()*

                Behaves the same as |teleport#api#find_match()| unless you
                pass a well-known symbol (e.g. `~` or `%:h`), in which case it
                expands without consulting the driver. This method is closest
                to the `:Z` command. It may change to include new behaviors in
                the future.

                Added in v0.3.0.
